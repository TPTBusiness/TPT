## ‚ú® Features

ü§ñ Hybrid Architecture: Combines a Transformer neural network for sequence-based trend prediction with PPO reinforcement learning for dynamic trade decisions (buy/sell, position sizing, stop-loss/take-profit, leverage).
üìä Technical Indicators:
RSI: Detects overbought/oversold conditions (window=14).
MACD: Captures momentum shifts (fast=12, slow=26, signal=9).
SMA/EMA: Smooths price trends for trend-following signals (window=20).
ATR: Measures volatility to guide risk management (window=14).
Bollinger Bands: Identifies volatility ranges for breakouts (window=20, deviation=2).
VWAP: Provides a volume-weighted price reference (window=14).
Volume Profile: Tracks cumulative volume (window=20).
Fibonacci Levels: Pinpoints support/resistance levels (window=20).


‚ö° Scalping Strategy: Targets rapid trades with a high risk-reward ratio, capitalizing on small price movements in minutes.
üè¶ Realistic Trading Environment: Simulates real-world trading with fees, leverage, margin constraints, and position limits.
üîß Hyperparameter Optimization: Fine-tuned parameters with checkpointing for robust performance.

**üöÄ How It Works**
The TPT Scalping Trading Model is a state-of-the-art system designed to excel in the fast-paced cryptocurrency market. Here‚Äôs a high-level overview of its core components:

üîç Market Analysis with Transformer Neural Network
The model employs a **Transformer neural network** to analyze 32-step sequences of market data, incorporating 15 technical indicators. It predicts short-term price trends with high accuracy, providing a probability of upward price movements. This predictive power enables the model to identify high-probability trading opportunities in volatile conditions.



**üéØ Trade Optimization with PPO Reinforcement Learning**
Using **PPO reinforcement learning**, the model optimizes trading decisions by learning a policy that balances profit and risk. It dynamically determines:
- **Trade Type**: Long, short, or no trade based on market signals.
- **Position Sizing**: Allocates 1-3% of capital per trade.
- **Stop-Loss/Take-Profit**: Sets volatility-adjusted levels (0.5-3% for stop-loss, 0.5-4% for take-profit).
- **Leverage**: Applies up to 100x, constrained by volatility and margin.  
The model maximizes returns while minimizing drawdowns, prioritizing short holding times and effective risk management.



**üè¶ Robust Trading Environment**
The model operates in a custom environment that mirrors real-world trading, incorporating:
- **Fees**: Maker/taker fees (0.01-0.02%) and funding rates (0.01%).
- **Position Limits**: Up to 10 simultaneous positions.
- **Margin and Leverage**: Enforces realistic margin and liquidation risks.
- **Volatility Adjustments**: Dynamically adjusts parameters based on market volatility.  
It supports backtesting and optional live trading with real-time data integration.



**‚ö° Scalping Strategy**
Optimized for **scalping**, the model executes rapid trades (average duration: 17.07 minutes) to exploit small price movements. Its high risk-reward ratio (13.06) ensures significant profits despite a low win rate (13.14%), making it ideal for the volatile BTCUSDT market.
